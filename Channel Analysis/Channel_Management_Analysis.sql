With gsearch doing well and the site performing better, we launched a second paid search channel, bsearch, around August 22.
Can you pull weekly trended session volume since then and compare to gsearch nonbrand so I can get a sense for how important this will be for the business?

I’m wondering if bsearch nonbrand should have the same bids as gsearch. Could you pull nonbrand conversion rates from session to order for gsearch and bsearch, and slice the

Based on your last analysis, we bid down bsearch nonbrand on December 2nd.
Can you pull weekly session volume for gsearch and bsearch nonbrand, broken down by device, since November 4th?
If you can include a comparison metric to show bsearch as a percent of gsearch for each device, that would be great too.
